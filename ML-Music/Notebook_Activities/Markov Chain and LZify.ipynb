    "## Markov-Based Chord Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In music, certain chord transitions are more likely than others. This idea can be applied as Markov Models, where the first-order temporal relationships between the various chords are captured by the transition probability matrix $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider only major and minor chords, there are a total of 24 chords in this model (12 major, from C through B, and 12 minor, from C through B), formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:ChordReco:HMM:App:Spec:SetStates}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{A} = \\{\\mathbf{C},\\mathbf{C}^\\sharp,\\ldots,\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{Cm},\\mathbf{Cm^\\sharp},\\ldots,\\mathbf{Bm}\\} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the notation $\\alpha{i}\\rightarrow\\alpha{j}$ referring to the transition from state $\\alpha{i}$ to state $\\alpha{j}$, $i,j\\in[1:24]$. For example, the coefficient $a_{1,2}$ expresses the \n",
    "probability for the transition $\\alpha_{1}\\rightarrow\\alpha_{2}$ (corresponding to  $\\mathbf{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{C}^\\sharp$), whereas $a_{1,8}$ expresses the probability for $\\alpha_{1}\\rightarrow\\alpha_{8}$  (corresponding to  $\\mathbf{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{G}$). In real music, the change from a tonic to the dominant is much more likely\n",
    "than transposing by one semitone, so that the probability $a_{1,8}$ should be much larger than $a_{1,2}$. The coefficients $a_{i,i}$ express the probability of staying in state $\\alpha_{i}$ (i.e., $\\alpha_{i}\\rightarrow\\alpha_{i}$), $i\\in[1:24]$. These coefficients are also referred to as **self-transition** probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transition probability matrix can be specified in many ways. For example, the matrix may be defined manually by a music expert based on rules from harmony theory. The most common approach is to generate such a matrix automatically \n",
    "by estimating the transition probabilities from labeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, you will create a Markov model by determining transition probabilities found in the music of the Beatles using bigrams (pairs of adjacent elements) in labeled frame sequences from a subset of the Beatles Corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, assume each row in the dataset represents a chord that has followed the chord on the previous row in a Beatles song. When parsing the file for your model, you may discard any chord references beyond key and major/minor quality. For example, if a row reads 'Bbm7', you would parse for the key (B-flat) and quality (minor), but discard the extra information that it is a 7th chord.  "
